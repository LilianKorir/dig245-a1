  <p><strong>Why I am taking this course</strong><br>I am taking Critical Web Design course because I want to gain the
    skills required to comunicate with others in a well formatted user experince they enjoy. Websites have become a tool
    used to share our experinces, market products and pass information or even simply tell the world about ourselves. I
    am taking this class in order to learn the work that goes into developing websites so that I can develop impressive
    websites that reflect projects and values I believe in and use it as a tool to inspire others and pass information.

        to famous religious tests such as the Bible scriptures. I ike this project because of its visual organization.

        that camputers attention. I also love the choice of lively colors that sets a warm and loving mood.

  <p> #DavidsonTrue<blockquote cite="https://www.davidson.edu/">Truth is an elusive concept these days­—but not at
      Davidson. For us, truth is not a set of answers, it’s a way of being­—defined by deep sincerity, intellectual
      bravery, unquestioned integrity, fundamental decency. This is the foundation that makes the Davidson experience a
      true examination of self and world. And why relationships formed here are ties that bind, with impact that is
      boundless.</blockquote>
